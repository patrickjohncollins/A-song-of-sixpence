A-song-of-sixpence
==================

Sing a song of sixpence...

The king was in his counting house,
Counting out his money;
The queen was in the parlour,
Eating bread and honey.

So, this is just a little personal finance app that I wrote to track my earning and spending.  It was also an experiment to teach myself the ASP.NET MVC framework as well as Entity Framework Code First.

The code is not pretty, but it meets my needs.  You can add create accounts, add transactions, import bank statements in OFX and QIF formats and reconcile those statements with transactions.

Transactions can be assigned categories.  I do statistical analysis using Excel PowerPivot that I point at the SQL Server database.

To run, you need Windows, IIS, ASP.NET and SQL Server express.
