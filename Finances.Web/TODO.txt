todo next time

bank recon
- cc transactions always appear as duplicates for previous statements, should rather compare based on 
- date/amount to see if transaction already exists.

small finitions
- why the hell do I have a column account_id in transaction table ?

budget transactions 
- fulfill automatically
- period ? repeat period ?
- as transactions are added during the period for the category, this amount will be reduced to zero
- need mechanism to clear out (unspent) budgets for past periods, or otherwise add to next period
- I don't care about past budgets, only future; you can't change the past
- how to roll budget transactions forward that currently finish at end of year ?

budgets to add
- pro bank 30€ / month
- pro transport 100€/month (modulauto)
- pro card transport 100€/month (train/plane)
- pro restaurant budget 100/month
- pro training, am I going to do the MS exams ?
- perso cash 300 € / month
- presents (annual budget ??) christmas budget ?? birthdays, sundry gifts..?
- budgeting groceries is quite tough... very variable, many payees!
 - chez marilou, 150€/month seems a little high, 100€ is a bit little, so 120€ seems about right.  Maybe 30€ / week instead?
 - intermarché around 200€ / month
 - I think I'm going to give up on Picard and buy my meat and fish on the way home from work
 - it would be interesting to seperate between food and household supplies
 - for the remainder around 50-100€ / month
- clothes : 150 € / month

- start thinking about future big expenses
 - house move
 - travel to greece
 - scooter
 - farm
 - engagement ring
 - aeron chair, arm, supports, new keyboard, treadmill

general todo

bank recon for pro card statement

prune dead code

bulk update/delete transactions (all matching transactions in filter)

calculate ht from total - tva

put bank statement lines on bank statement details view

app crash when uploading a bank statement and no associated account

set up an account for smartview, put all invoices into this account, payments go in as seperate transactions
- right now I can't simply see how much money smartview owes me
- I wonder if bank statements shouldn't go in as normal transactions?  No, that's crazy talk.

I am not reinventing the wheel here ?

remember the filters on the transaction list page

rewrite all sp using ef

rewrite balance over time using ef and chart control

rewrite transactions by category by month as an html table
- I want if there is a good pivot table js component, that could link to OData for small data sets? (ex. up to 10k lines)

investigate the possibility of using sql calculated columns for totals (credit-debit) to ensure data consistancy

users
